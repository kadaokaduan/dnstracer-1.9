WHAT IS DNSTRACER?

Dnstracer determines where a given Domain Name Server (DNS) gets
its information from, and follows the chain of DNS servers back to
the servers which know the data.

Its behaviour is similair to ntptrace(8), which does it for the
NTP protocol.

HOW TO INSTALL?

In theory, run 'configure', 'make' and 'make install' should be
enough to install the binary and the man-page. I've developed it
under FreeBSD 4.4 and tested it on Debian, SunOS and Solaris. Due
to the nature of autoconf and friends, you need GNU Make.

If you don't want to have IPv6 support in it, run configure with
the --disable-ipv6 option.

Windows users with Microsoft Visual C++ please use MSVB.BAT (supplied
