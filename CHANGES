Version 1.9:
	- With the rollout of IPv6 for a.root-servers.net, it always
	  took the IPv6 address even if you used the -4 option.
	- Fix false lame server issues with domains which have the
	  higher domain in it (command.com for example).

Version 1.8.1:
	- Put back timeout command line parameter, it will be the
	  maximum time to wait instead of an increasing one.

Version 1.8:
	- Better handling of timeout (instead of a static value,
	  start with five seconds and double it each retry)
	- Warnings are printed if you receive a different RR type
	  than the one you asked for (for example when you ask for
	  an A record and receive a CNAME)
	- Fixed problems when records received in the authority
	  field are shorter than the domain the nameserver is
	  authoritative for.
	- When compiled without IPv6 support on an IPv6 capable
	  machine the machine tried to query the IPv6 translated
	  IPv5 address anyway.
	- -C caches hosts which haven't answered too.

Version 1.7.1:
	- Fix display of SOA serial number, by Janne Snabb
	  <snabb@epipe.com>
	- Non-IPv6 builds should not use gethostbyname2()

Version 1.7:
	- Removed a debug-line while doing PTR requests.
	- Now IPv6 servers are traced too. Use -4 to disable it.
	- Added -S option for specifying source IP address.

version 1.6:
	- Added SOA record tracing
	- Fixed a debug duplicate variable printing.

version 1.5:
	- Sometimes it happened while tracing a name without
	  specifying a server it would return immediatly without
	  printing any information.
	- names with a trailing dot are now handled correctly.
	- warning from Kris Kennaway <kris@obsecurity.org> regarding
	  sprintf()'s without format-strings (yes, I feel ashamed).
	- On request of Anthony DeRobertis <asd@suespammers.org>,
	  via Thomas Seyrat <tomasera@debian.org>, support for PTR
	  records.

version 1.4:
	- Added -Wall to Makefile.am so at least I would get warnings
	  from my C compiler thank you. Removed some stupid unused
	  variables.
	- Fixed big/little endian problem in the structs so that the
	  flags are looking allright now.
	- Answers are displayed as authoritative or normal.
	- Digging goes on until we have hit an authorative server.
	- Info about which zone is being queried now.

version 1.3:
	- added win32 support by Mike Black <mblack@csihq.com>
	- fixed bug where the IP addresses in the resource records
	  wouldn't be used.
	- when an authority NS record wouldn't have an additional
	  A record it can get multiple IP addresses when it resolves
	  the hostname in the gethostbyname(). This is now handled
	  correctly.

version 1.2:
	- renamed into dnstracer due to clash with DJBDNS's dnstracer.
	- dnstracer would segfault if nameserver name couldn't be
	  resolved (by Vilhelm Bergman <d96v@dtek.chalmers.se>)
	- support for /etc/resolv.conf via a patch from Moritz
	  Barsnick <moritz@barsnick.net>
	- -s . will take A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET
	- autoconf/automake support... *shudder*
	- support for different query-classes.
	- Gerd v. Egidy <egidy@deam.de> gave it RPM capabilities
	  and checked the automake/autoconf construction.

version 1.1:
	- fixed problems for big-endian little-endian machines.
	- fixed linking problem on Solaris. Use Makefile.sun for them.

version 1.0:
	- initial release
